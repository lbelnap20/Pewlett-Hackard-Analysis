- The top two employment titles affected are Senior Engineer (29,141) and Senior Staff (28,255)
- The top two employment titles elibible for the mentorship program are Staff (438) and Senior Engineer (413)


## Summary 
There will be a total of 88,798 roles that will need to be filled in the coming years. However we do not cuurently know how many of these employees plan on retiring once they become eligible, thus the impact could be lessened as retirements are stagged over a period of time. Under the current mentorship eligiblity guidelines, only a total of 1,549 employees qualify. Assuming the company loses 8,879 employees per year over the next 10 years, that leaves a gap of 7,330 of new employees who would not be mentored. The company may want to reevaluate mentorship qualifications in order to expand the program, or choose to focus the program on specific job titles.
